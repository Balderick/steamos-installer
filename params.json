{"name":"Ye Olde SteamOSe","tagline":"a modified SteamOS installer, with support for older and virtualized computers","body":"## The future is here, but it's a bit new isn't it?\r\nSteamOS is now shipping, in beta form at least, and it's all cool and stuff.\r\n\r\nBut what about those of us without a modern, UEFI-based computer spare?\r\n\r\nYe Olde SteamOSe is for you.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* SteamOS requires UEFI. Ye Olde SteamOSe works with UEFI or BIOS\r\n* SteamOS requires a USB Stick to install. Ye Olde SteamOSe works from a DVD or a USB Stick\r\n* SteamOS requires a real computer. Ye Olde SteamOSe has 3D acceleration on VMWare and Virtualbox, out of the box\r\n* SteamOS says it needs 500GB of disk space, but that's a lie. Ye Olde SteamOSe requires the same amount of space as SteamOS really does - 30.5GB plus space for games\r\n\r\n![SteamOS running in VMWare Workstation 10](http://i.imgur.com/a3jnZ6r.png)\r\n\r\n## Planned improvements\r\n* Remove NVIDIA assumptions\r\n\r\n## How to install?\r\nA DVD image will be made available soon. Otherwise, clone this repo, fix gen.sh for your paths, and run it. This yeolde.iso file will work if burned, or dd'd to a USB stick. Beyond that, just follow Valve's instructions from http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n* Recovery partition capture totally breaks right now. Just restart your computer when it inevitably drops to an initramfs prompt after running the post_install.sh script.\r\n\r\n## How can I help?\r\nTest it and report back to #steamos on Freenode\r\n\r\nOr support me by donating - VMWare Workstation is a whopping Â£190, so when the 30 day trial expires, I stop testing with it.
