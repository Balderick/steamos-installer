Right now these scripts can be tested by moving files into the following directories:

/etc/
        actkbd-steamos-controller.conf

/etc/udev/rules.d/
        99-actkbd-controller.rules

/usr/local/bin/
        steamos-displayfps.sh
        steamos-recording.sh
        steamos-restart.sh
        steamos-screenshot.sh
        
After you've done that, reboot and you'll be able to use button combinations on your Xbox 360 controller to do various things. 
Take a look at actkbd-steamos-controller.conf for more details.
